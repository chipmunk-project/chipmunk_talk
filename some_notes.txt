1.
Show the output of Chipmunk by using some toy examples
i.e  program vs Chipmunk_with_holes
 --> program vs Chipmunk_with_hole_vals
 --> Show why this works.
We should find some "easy" benchmarks to show the whole process

2.
Some of the reviewers think there are too many research questions
which is more like a grant proposal. Probably we should collect
them into future direction part.

3.
Where is the main part of our contribution?
3.1 Use synthesis method to write fast-programing code?
or
3.2 Use the output of previous stage as the input of next stage
    to imporve successful compilation rate

4.
Get more figure from Sketch dissertation or create some by our
own to explain the Sketch better

5.
Rewrite one sentence of 2.1 "" to make it clear to understand

6.
Compare the compilation time of domino vs Chipmunk

7.
Focus on programmable switch or programmable substrates?

8.
Limitations: looks like we should not end with We have not yet designed a translator
